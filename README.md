Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This Python project creates a simulated smart thermostat system on a Raspberry Pi, demonstrating core functionalities like state management, user interaction, data display, and external communication. The primary problem it addresses is how to build an interactive embedded system for environmental control, serving as a practical exercise in integrating hardware components (LEDs, buttons, LCD) with software logic. In its initial form, it aimed to incorporate a physical temperature sensor, but recent adaptations have shifted to a simulated temperature due to sensor connectivity challenges.



What did you do particularly well?

What I did particularly well in this project was the structured approach to design, especially the implementation of the StateMachine class for managing the thermostat's operational modes. This clearly defines and separates the "off," "heat," and "cool" states, making the behavior predictable and easy to follow. The use of threading for the LCD display management (in manageMyDisplay) is another strong point, as it prevents the display updates from blocking the main program loop, ensuring a responsive user experience and consistent monitoring of inputs. Furthermore, the clear distinction between hardware abstraction (GPIO Zero, Adafruit libraries) and application logic contributed to a robust design.

Where could you improve?

One significant area for improvement is error handling and resilience for hardware components. While the code includes basic exception handling for KeyboardInterrupt, it lacks more specific mechanisms to gracefully manage common hardware failures, such as a disconnected LCD or a non-responsive serial port. 



What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

From this project, I'm adding Raspberry Pi GPIO documentation and community forums to my support network. The intricate nature of hardware interfacing, especially when debugging issues like I2C communication, necessitates detailed pinout diagrams and community-driven troubleshooting guides. The gpiozero and adafruit_circuitpython libraries' documentation also becomes a key resource for understanding hardware abstraction layers and their best practices. Lastly, specific I2C communication protocols and debugging tools (i2cdetect) are now crucial parts of my go-to resources for embedded systems development.



What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

The skills honed in this project will be highly transferable to other projects and coursework. The most significant is the application of state machines for managing complex system behaviors, a fundamental concept in embedded systems and control logic that applies far beyond thermostats. Proficiency in interfacing with various hardware components (GPIO, I2C, serial communication) on a single-board computer is invaluable for any IoT or robotics project. Moreover, the practice of concurrent programming with threading for managing separate, time-sensitive tasks is critical for responsive applications. Finally, the ability to debug integrated hardware/software systems, including understanding OSError and ValueError outputs related to physical connections, is a practical skill that translates directly to real-world engineering challenges.



How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

This project was designed for maintainability, readability, and adaptability through several practices. Clear and comprehensive comments are abundant, explaining the purpose of each section, class, and method, which is vital for anyone new to the codebase. The use of classes (ManagedDisplay, TemperatureMachine) encapsulates related functionalities, promoting modularity and making it easier to understand and modify specific parts without affecting others. Descriptive variable and method names also enhance readability. For adaptability, the DEBUG flag allows for easy toggling of verbose console output during development. The state machine pattern itself makes the core logic highly adaptable; adding new thermostat modes or changing transition rules would involve modifying states and events within TemperatureMachine rather than overhauling the entire control flow. The recent shift to a simulated temperature also demonstrates its adaptability, allowing continued development even when a physical sensor is unavailable.
